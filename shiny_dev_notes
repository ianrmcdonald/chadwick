HOORAY.  Now to control this thing

1.  tabs
2.  dates are not sorting as dates...need dataTable
      to represent them that way.
3.  make source run quietly

5.  themes screw up paging with DataTable

6.  Old Washington National players still showing up in two team.  

7.  Deal with threshold being "less than" vs. "greater than"

8.  Fix column widths

9.  Need HOF CSV. DONE

10.  Download the 16 people files

11.  THEMES

12.  Make nameWhole a permanent part of people_raw

13.  Data table number displays are incomprehensible

Discovered that BA doesn't consider original Baltimore Orioles part of the
New York Yankee franchise; arguably they are.  1901-1902 affected.  I removed the
combination from teamFranch.
